        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
        encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

        Ukraine has a long history, which reflects numerous periods of its
        prosperity and decay. But the desire of Ukrainian people to be
        independent was kept through the passing centuries. The first attempt to
        achieve independence was made by Bohdan Khmelnitsky in 1648â€”1654.
